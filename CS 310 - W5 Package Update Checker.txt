CS 310 - W5 Package Update Checker
By Heidi Blank

How did you get the list of packages?
- I used the apt command "list --upgradable" to get the list of packages.

What is the crontab sequence to run the script?
- The crontab sequence is 0 0 * * 1 to run the cron jobs weekly.

Since this script would require root, how do you install a crontab for root?
- I used the keyword 'sudo' in front of crontab commands in order to use root
when installing cron jobs.
